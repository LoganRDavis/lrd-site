                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am a Fluent programmer and despite my University courses, I have learned most of what I know from
                    experience in projects and online resources. I am a quick learner and focused worker who has to stay
                    busy.
                    I have experience managing people and excel at delegation and time management. I enjoy new
                    challenges
                    and branching out to new technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    I started my own company as the sole software and hardware engineer. To summarize the company, I
                    develop, and my partner sells technology devices and services such as wireless RF call buttons and
                    temperature sensors. We then provide a web app that allows for analysis and setup of email and
                    texting
                    notifications based on user preferences. As the sole technology provider, I have experience
                    developing
                    database schemas, restful APIs, microcontroller processes, multithreaded hub controller units, and
                    front-end user experiences. I designed PCB schematics using Eagle CAD and worked with foreign
                    manufacturers to acquire parts. I have also worked with external services such as SendGrid, Twilio,
                    and Google Cloud to provide an all-encompassing service.
